# Sportsbet
This python script is designed to output a table of data about a race and provide a suggestion as to which horse has the highset EV. It is designed to be used on races where there is a promo running where you get a bonus bet matching your stake if your choice to win runs 2nd or 3rd. However, all the data in the table except the EV cols is still relevant for a race without a promo running. Can be used on a horse, greyhound or harness race. The data table includes:

+ Horse Info
+ Horse Odds
+ Implied win chance
+ Edge adjusted win chance
+ Horse EV
